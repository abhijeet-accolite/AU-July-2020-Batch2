Tasks :

1. Create a database for the Hospital Management System based on your ER. Create appropriate tables & relationships.
CREATE DATABASE HosptialManagementDb;
USE HosptialManagementDb;
CREATE TABLE EmployeeType(
   ETypeId   INT              NOT NULL,
   ETypyName VARCHAR(10)     NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (ETypeId)
);

CREATE TABLE Employee(
   EmployeeID   INT              NOT NULL,
   ETypeId   INT              NOT NULL,
   ENAME VARCHAR (50)     NOT NULL,
   EAGE  INT              NOT NULL,
   EADDRESS  VARCHAR (50) ,
   ESALARY   INT,
   DEPID INT,
   PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID)
);

CREATE TABLE HOSPITAL(
   HID   INT              NOT NULL,
   HNAME VARCHAR (50)     NOT NULL,
   HADDRESS  VARCHAR (50) ,
   PRIMARY KEY (HID)
);
CREATE TABLE PATIENT(
   PID   INT              NOT NULL,
   PNAME VARCHAR (50)     NOT NULL,
   PAGE  INT              NOT NULL,
   PGENDER VARCHAR(6),
   PADDRESS  VARCHAR (50) ,
   DID   INT,
   DOA DATE,
   DOD DATE,
   PRIMARY KEY (PID)
);

CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT(
   DEPID   INT              NOT NULL,
   DEPNAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY (DEPID)
);




2. Design a query to provide a list of doctors, which department they belong to and patients treated by them (if any).
SELECT dbo.DEPARTMENT.DEPNAME, dbo.Employee.ENAME, dbo.PATIENT.PNAME
FROM     dbo.DEPARTMENT INNER JOIN
                  dbo.Employee ON dbo.DEPARTMENT.DEPID = dbo.Employee.DEPID CROSS JOIN
                  dbo.PATIENT


3. Query to provide the count of patients discharged per day in the last week. 
select DOD,COUNT(PNAME) from  PATIENT where DOD BETWEEN '2020-08-07' and '2020-08-14' GROUP BY DOD;
